Title:  Bank Accounts
Date: 11/19/2015
Purpose:  This program is to simulate a bank by letting customers create their new bank accounts, deposit money into their 
bank accounts, withdraw money from their bank accounts, and check their account balances.  

//accounts array
var accounts = [];

//creates a new account
function createAccount(account){
	accounts.push(account);
	return account;
}

//gets the account provided its username
function getAccount(username){
	var matchAccount;
	accounts.forEach(function (account) {
		if(account.username === username){
			matchAccount = account;
		}

	});

	return matchedAccount;
}

//deposits money into the account
function deposit(account, amount){
	account.balance += amount;
}

//withdraws money from the account
function withdraw(account, amount){
	account.balance -= amount;
}

//gets the account balance
function getBalance(account){
	return account.balance;
}

//creates two new accounts
var bensAccount = createAccount({
	username: 'bmcgahee',
	balance: 0
});

var ricksAccount = createAccount({
	username: 'rmcgahee4',
	balance: 2000
});

//test data
//checks to see if deposit, withdraw, and getAccount functions work properly

//deposits $500 into Ben's bank account and gets his current balance.
deposit(bensAccount, 500);
console.log(getBalance(bensAccount));

//withdraws $10 from Ben's bank account and gets his current balance.
withdraw(bensAccount, 10);
console.log(getBalance(bensAccount));

//checks to see if account exists with the username 'bmcgahee' and gets Ben's account balance.
var existingAccount = getAccount('bmcgahee');
console.log(getBalance(bensAccount));

//prints out all of the bank accounts in the accounts array.
console.log(accounts);

//checks to see if account exists with the username 'rmcgahee4' and gets Rick's account balance.
var existingRicksAccount = getAccount('rmcgahee4');
console.log(existingRicksAccount);
