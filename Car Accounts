Title:  Car Accounts
Date: 11/19/2015
Purpose:  This program allows you to create a car account, get the sale price of a car, determine the value of the car
after owning it for a particular number of years, and tells you what mileage to get your next oil change.  

//Initialize the empty cars array.
var cars = [];

//createCar function creates a car account with make, model, year, mileage, and price
function createCar(car){
	cars.push(car);
	return car;
}

//carValue function returns the value of the car after a certain number of years
function carValue(car, years){
	for(year = 1; year <= years; year++){
		value = car.price * Math.pow(0.8, year);
	    roundValue = Math.round(value);
	    result = 'The value of the ' + car.make + ' after ' + year + ' years is ' + '$' + roundValue + '.';
	    console.log(result);
	}
}

//getPrice function tells the sale price of the car when inputting the make and model.
function getPrice(make, model){
	var currentPrice;
	cars.forEach(function (car){
		if(car.make === make && car.model === model){
			currentPrice = car.price;
		}
	});
	result = 'The price of the ' + make + ' is ' + '$' + currentPrice + '.';
	return result;
}

//getOilChange function tells when to get the next oil change.  
function getOilChange(car){
	oilChange = car.mileage + 3000;
	result = 'Your car needs an oil change when your odometer reading says ' + oilChange + ' miles.';
	return result;
}

//create car account called bensCar
var bensCar = createCar({
	make: 'Chevrolet',
	model: 'Cruze',
	year: 2013,
	mileage: 1249,
	price: 13500
});

//create car account called ricksCar
var ricksCar = createCar({
	make: 'Nissan',
	model: 'Murano',
	year: 2011,
	mileage: 372,
	price: 30000
});

//print out the car accounts from the cars array
console.log(cars);

//returns the value of Ben's car after owning it for 5 years
carValue(bensCar, 5);

//returns the value of Rick's car after owning it for 5 years
carValue(ricksCar, 5);
