Title:  Modified Bank Account
Date:  11/22/2015
Purpose:  This program is the modified version of the Bank Account program that simulates a real bank account, 
which allows you to create an account, deposit and withdraw money, and check the account information and balance.  
The deposit and withdraw methods contain input validation to make sure numerical values are entered to either
deposit or withdraw from the account.  If no numerical values are entered, then the account holder will receive an
error message.

//accounts array
var accounts = [];

//creates a new account
function createAccount(account){
	accounts.push(account);
	return account;
}

//gets the account provided its username
function getAccount(username){
	var matchAccount;
	var i = 0;
	while(i < accounts.length){
		if(accounts[i].username === username)
			matchedAccount = accounts[i];
		i++;
	}

	return matchAccount;
}

//deposits money into the account
//checks to see if the user entered a numerical value for the deposit
//if not then the account holder receives an error message that the deposit failed
function deposit(account, amount){
	if(typeof amount === 'number')
		account.balance += amount;
	else 
		console.log('Sorry, the deposit failed.  Please enter a number for the deposit amount.');
}

//withdraws money from the account
//checks to see if the user entered a numerical value for the withdrawal
//if not then the account holder receives an error message that the withdrawal failed
function withdraw(account, amount){
	if(typeof amount === 'number')
		account.balance -= amount;
	else
		console.log('Sorry, the withdrawal failed.  Please enter a number for the withdrawal amount.');
}

//gets the account balance using a closure (function within a function)
function createBalanceGetter(account){
	return function () {
		return account.balance;
	}
}


//create Ben's account
var bensAccount = createAccount({
	username: 'bmcgahee', 
	balance: 0});

//deposit $500 and withdraw $20 from Ben's account
deposit(bensAccount, 500);
withdraw(bensAccount, 20);

//test deposit and withdrawal with strings, should get an error message to use numerical values
deposit(bensAccount, 'one hundred');
withdraw(bensAccount, 'eighty');

//gets Ben's account information
var getBensAccount = getAccount('bmcgahee');
console.log(getBensAccount);

//gets Ben's account balance
getBenBalance = createBalanceGetter(bensAccount);
console.log(getBenBalance());
